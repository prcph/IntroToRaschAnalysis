# Preface {-}

This book is a work-in-progress. The book aims to provide in-depth instruction on how to conduct a Rasch analysis using Winsteps, Facets and some of the R packages like eRm. Data used in this book have been published in the Leeds data repository. I intend to use R for additional analyses not currently available with Winsteps adn Facets. Recent updates to this software now provide some functionality for using R. However, I will try to provide additional examples of how data from Winsteps and Faceta can be visualised and analysed with R.
